                <h4>Perfumes to wear with Pride</h4>
                <p>The Jean Paul Gaultier Pride collection this year features a whoop of ‘Liberty, Equality, Sexuality! Two bottles, one inclusive fragrance created for everyone: discover the limited edition Le Male and Classique Pride – a colourful statement on the Classique and Le Male navy-striped sailor tops. Jean Paul Gaultier proudly supports the LGBTQIA+ Community through AKT. This year, The Fragrance Shop is also proud to partner with the charity AKT, who supports young LGBTQ+ people across the UK who are either homeless or living in a hostile environment. TFS will be supporting AKT by donating 5p of every in-store transaction to the charity, with customers able to donate an extra 25p with any purchase of the PRIDE collection in-store.’With heady blood orange and yuzu top notes, this unisex eau de toilette marches to a beat that is resolutely modern, quirky, and free-spirited, uniting all in its wake. A proud and celebratory floral citrus fragrance enhanced with orange blossom and neroli, and a bouquet of musky and sensual blond woods.</p>

                <h4>Trending Now… Rhubarb!</h4>
                <p>Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb… No, we’re not practicing being an extra in a film (it’s what they traditionally mutter while appearing to chat in the background, FYI!) – rhubarb is proving a hugely popular trend in perfumery, so let’s get to the crunch of this vibrantly fruity fragrance note.
                    We first started seeing rhubarb making a fizz around 2015, but now the note is hugely popular and has set its own scent trend. How come? Well rhubarb is one of the happiest notes in fragrance, its bright, zippy character is distinctive, fun yet with a properly grown up poise to it – it definitely feels more sophisticated than many fruity notes in fragrance.
                    While providing a modern twist to classic floral or citrus bouquets, it simultaneously has more than a whiff of nostalgia about it, too – most of us have fond childhood memories of eating it baked in a crumble, or just freshly picked, raw and dipped in sugar. 
                    Despite rhubarb’s unmistakable tartness, it manages to play very nicely with other perfumery ingredients – melding wonderfully with violet, jazzing up a rose or other fruity cocktail-like notes, and adding an energising ZING of freshness that’s perhaps more intriguing than your average citrus.

                <h4>Scenting Wimbledon – new bottles, please!</h4>
                <p>As sure a sign of summer as your neighbour who seemingly mows their lawn thrice a day, Wimbledon is a welcome signal to pop the corks, open the starwberries and (for us at PSHQ) to don the whites while shouting “New bottles, please!” So, with such fragrant fun in mind, we present our whimsical scenting of the Wimbledon games to come…
                    <br>
                    MALIN + GOETZ
                    Strawberry
                    Forget overly sweet or boring: this is a contemporary strawberry ‘reimagined’ by the artistic team at Malin + Goetz. They ‘deconstructed’ and reinterpret the garden strawberry, invoking its luscious freshness via bright shafts of pink pepper and bergamot, given a floral flourish by orris root, jasmine petals and warm musks.
                    Maison Margiela
                    When the Rain Stops
                    There comes a moment during Wimbledon when, inevitably, the heavens open. Much banter ensues, British sense of humour to the fore. But at least we can revel in the scent of ‘petrichor’ after the rain stops, so beautifully evoked here in another of this so-clever niche fragrance house’s scent memories. Think nose-tingling pink pepper awakening dewy leaves, encouraging Isparta roses and jasmine to bloom.

                <h4>The Good Oudh Guide</h4>
                <p>Oudh (often also spelled oud) is omnipotent – way beyond the ‘trend’ it was first thought of when it began wafting in the fragrance aisles of the Western hemisphere, it’s practically become its own perfume family. Though beloved in the Middle East and in many cultures around the world for centuries, there are some who still clutch their pearls a little at the mere mention of the word, let alone a whiff of that ultra-woody, multi-faceted fragrance.

                    But all oudhs are not the same beast (though they can indeed be redolent of the farmyard), and just as with any fragrance ingredient, depending on the type, quality and quantity the perfumer has used, the over-arching olfactory effect can be massively different. Think of it like giving a cheese naysayer to a slab of blue-veined Stilton as their very first taste, or an oozingly ripe Camembert – perhaps a more gentle intro might have been a nibble at a mild Cheddar, or the cool, crumbly creaminess of a Wensleydale? It’s the same with any potentially heady ingredient in a fragrance, you might want to dip your toes in a softer evocation before drenching yourself with the olfactory equivalent of an offensive weapon.</p>
